GAMEPLAY NOTES
Aaaaa
Story
-General
You are a droid, living in the [SWAMP] peripheral district of Nouveau Metro. Someone calls you from an unfamiliar number in [Arctic Cyburbia]. It’s your cousin. They’re calling from prison as they’ve been jailed for Bounce Ball Crimes. They deny the charges, but any resolution would be too late for them to compete in the next World circuit. Their spot needs filling and they want you to fill it. You’re only an amateur racer, but this could be your chance to prove yourself on the world stage, so you accept.
Racers
The Cousin: The star of SWAMPTOWN, they taught you everything about racing that the internet couldn’t. You two are on mostly good terms, but there’s a distance between you that’s only grown since the moved to ARCTIC CITY. An all-around amazing racer, though a little (very) cocky.
SWAMP WITCH: Old. Runs the tutorial track and helps get you used to racing again. She somehow made a racer out of wood.
VOID: Self-proclaimed rival to YOUR COUSIN, with an unhealthy obsession with beating them in the world series. They project some of this rivalry on to you. Extremely aggressive on the track, but much more reserved and polite everywhere else. Has kind of a stoic, edgy persona that softens as they get more familiar.
Lemon: The first racer you meet in NOUVEAU METRO. Sweet and kind, but competitive to a fault. Don’t let her personality fool you, as LEMON is ruthless on the track. She tries to be as self-sufficient as possible, and built her own unorthodox racer that has nodules on the sides of its bubble that make it resemble a lemon.
Sharky: Spikes on the bubble allow for better traction.
Spitbug: Shy, avoids other racers on the track.
Lunarcore:
Graffiti Wizard:
Fishtank: Racer is filled with water, or some kind of dense fluid, reducing its bounce and letting it build up more momentum.
virus: racer looks like a virus [IDEA, RACER CAN STICK TO AND DETACH FROM OTHER RACERS]
Lightstreak: Cowboy. Spends a lot of time looking at the sky.
MeltyChrome: 
Minimalist:
Bandana:
Grease Ape: Scrunged together a racer from the best parts of old broken ones.
Hotrod: Dry badlands provide the perfect conditions for maintaining her pristine hotrod of a bounce ball racer. Scratch her ride and die.
Coppa Smoke: “My wife left me... Racing dulls the pain.” An ex-cop disillusioned with police work. She spends most of her off-time drinking, smoking, and listening to sad classic rock.
Neon Mask: Depressed as fuck, but dealing with it. They use their position as a prominent racer to advocate for social causes, and is sometimes accused of pushing politics too hard, though they disagree. NEON MASK is hated by the ARCTIC CITY council, but is popular with the general populace of ARCTIC CITY, as well as abroad. They wear a mask because it’s easier than consistent facial grooming.
BONUS – Spherical Visitor: An alien whose spherical shape, with a dense core and cushioned, gaseous outer shell makes them perfectly suited for BOUNCE BALL RACING.
